<strong> <a name="1"> Holy Water </strong> <br>
<em>
<p>Ye pristine waters, 
do just not drench my body,<br>
but also hail my mind with thy mystic flow.<br>
Take me to thy perennial eternities.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="2"> Memories </strong> <br>
<em>
<p>Times ago, I remember those twilight skies,<br> 
with dwindling lights of sunny evenings' riven,<br>
which casted joys onto our glorious lives,<br>
like backyard blossoms of a golden heaven.<br>
Filled with silence were the chirps and tweet,<br>
of the birds and women which sans no heed.<br>
All-pervading aromas are as always sweet,<br>
from supper's cinnamon to cardamom seed.</p>

<p>Lying back on my garden chair,<br>
I slipped and lost in my dream's affair.<br>
As day by day the time rolled by,<br>
my vault of thoughts enchanted "I".<br>
The past reveals what the memories feels,<br>
to the tunes of a song that the life believes.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="3"> Sunrise </strong> <br>
<em>
<p>I rise over the golden meadows,<br>
shattering shades of the dark shadows.<br>
I glide through vallies across the hills,<br>
blessing the newly constructed mills.<br>
I harvest the farmer's golden yields,<br>
safeguarding life forms and the fields.</p>

<p>Routine was good, but I don't know why,<br>
a change startled the world really high.<br>
Ain't you all happy with your need,<br>
else grew hungry by Satan's greed?<br>
With an emergence of shades of grey,<br>
began the mocking and heckling of hay.<br>
Extending high up into the sky,<br>
whom do you think you can surpass by?<br>
You have forgotten to gratify your roots,<br>
instead scorned your growth to ashes of soot.</p>

<p>Life constricted to a debris of shelves,<br>
soon you will realise what you have lost by self.<br>
Only in search of the nature's lap,<br>
you can rest your pathos to an eternal nap.<br>
Finally, the era shall repeat,<br>
where ego will surrender in defeat.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="4"> Language of Silence </strong> <br>
<em>
<p>I wonder if they do,<br>
speak like us or, else who?<br>
They do it differently,<br>
sense feelings over wordings effectively.<br>
For that art we lack,<br>
was lost far long back.<br>
Relinquish your mental tense,<br>
learn to speak in the language of silence.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="5"> Time </strong>
<br>
<em> 
<p>Dissolve me until my zenith's last,<br>
resurrect me from the ashes of my past.<br>
Swallow me at a rate of constant,<br>
do revive me at every instant.<br>
Slip away with the sigh of my last breath,<br>
as in you are my life until my death.<br>
Drown me to thy shallows,<br>
elevate me to the heavenly hallows.<br>
Thou art the universal solvent,<br>
Anything and Everything, I wonder what you aren't.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="6"> Inner Being </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>At the core, deep inside you,<br>
lies a resident, if you could view.<br>
Unveil him, from the layers of darkness,<br>
under the lights of your internal brightness.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="7"> Emotions </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Inscribe thoughts on arcs of miniature,<br>
as you are an architect by nature.<br>
Carve your pillars of emotion,<br>
with tools of will and determination.<br>
Etch your rugged feeling,<br>
refine its values with new detailing.<br>
Let the doors be open apart,<br>
into the monasteries of your heart.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="8"> Tales </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Through the frames of the window pane,<br>
outside the moving train,<br>
they stretched a long way, along the lane.<br>
As the twilight of the skyline pales,<br>
the nature begins to narrate her fairy tales.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="9"> Consciousness </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Lull the time to hibernation,<br>
to witness reality and imagination.<br>
You realise only when,<br>
you are fully awaken.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="10"> Perception per se </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>I see,<br>
you see.<br>
You may not see,<br>
what I see,<br>
because we owe to that reality,<br>
from the dimensions of our own.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="11"> Voice of the Ocean </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>I came to you,<br>
to confess in despair.<br>
Before I started talking,<br>
you stared speaking.<br>
You went on and on and on,<br>
never let me in for my chance.<br>
Unless you stopped,<br>
I would never start.<br>
You would never stop,<br>
nor could I ever start.<br>
But I shall wait,<br>
with patience,<br>
no more to confess,<br>
but only to hear from you.<br>
I shall wait for a lifetime,<br>
to hear you, all the time.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="12"> Free Will </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>If colourful wings are the fate of a butterfly,<br> 
this imagination is the free will of a dragonfly.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="13"> Unity </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Thou art only a token,<br>
until thy silence's spoken.<br>
Before thine existence broken,<br>
discover that thou art.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="14"> Symmetry </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>The rhythm in geometry,<br>
is akin to a rhyme in poetry.</p>

<p>I to you, you to me are complementary,<br>
in the language of symmetry.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="15"> Heritage </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Ode to the chronicles of the soil,<br>
hymn to the glory of their royal.<br>
With a symphony of culture and art,<br>
the stones resonate the melodies of their heart.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="16"> Decision </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Every step you make,<br>
drives you onto a new path.<br>
Every path you take,<br>
leads you to unknown milestones.<br>
Every milestone you pass,<br>
draws you closer to your destiny.<br>
Every destiny you reach,<br>
awaits the beginning of your next step.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="17"> Music </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>I can't remember the music of the melody,<br>
that holds a promise to my broken memory.<br>
It kills my mind as I type..<br>
but fills my heart with joy, that I can't describe.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="18"> Happy New Year </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>First, second, thenceforth another second,<br>
swept away from the life of time,<br>
yet does it revives, through relay of an eternal mime.<br>
Whence wondered what hath changed,<br>
worried were numbers, hurried to be interchanged.<br>
Sequence by sequence as cycles revolved,<br>
the same old patterns reappeared, as numbers evolved.</p>

<p>With hope in our hearts we do welcome,<br>
all the happiness and joy we cannot fathom.<br>
Little do we imagine about the thoughts we render,<br>
the truly transformed are only the digits of a number.<br>
The world around you might seem dark and empty,<br>
but do not forget the starlight within you is plenty.<br>
In the end, there is nothing to say or hear,<br>
besides a courtesy to wish 'Happy New Year'.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="19"> Life </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>For, success is the summit of a pinnacle,<br>
failures are the spears of an icicle.<br>
While, both are extreme and sharp,<br>
wise are those who are balanced and do not harp.<br>
The secret is to humbly accept and move on,<br>
as the magic in true beauty, is the life that lies beyond.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="20"> Almighty </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Unknown is the origin to his legend,<br>
he who dwells in you and me until the end.<br>
His reverence is holy as an ancient mythology,<br>
par scientific with a mystic philosophy.</p>

<p>O all-pervading, omnipresent, almighty,<br>
chanted many in his name to reach this deity.<br>
The conqueror of the five elements of nature,<br>
is the scintillating source to the saints as a teacher.<br>
Ever wondered what does the swayer of the universe do?<br>
is simply meditate like every other yoga guru!</p>

<p>He who shall perceive his conscience with serenity,<br>
can unveil the mysteries of life with the blessings of his divinity.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="21"> Pain </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>I closed my eyes to see,<br>
the pain that was inside of me.<br>
I covered my ears to hear,<br>
the cry of my own tears.<br>
I shut my mouth to talk,<br>
with the inner voices that mock.<br>
My quest went on, and on, and on,<br>
from yes to no, to no to yes and so on...</p>

<p>Truth was found where the secrets died,<br>
as in there wasn’t any other place to hide.<br>
Joy and pain inflicted again,<br>
which I wish, I could explain.<br>
I know there’s nothing left to do,<br>
when what I had and lost was you!</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="22"> Philosophy of Life </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>One day, a seed and a tree,<br>
were talking just like you and me.<br>
Then the seed asked the tree who,<br>
Was that inside of me were you?<br>
The tree smiled and then replied,<br>
"I, perhaps you, are always one,<br>
like the void of null is anyways none".<br>
"We live inside", of each other, it implied.</p>

<p>A question prevailed deep in our mind,<br>
back in time since there was no mankind.<br>
Times ago, before the beginning of history,<br>
life had unveiled a story, of a seed and the tree.<br>
You dwell in me, for I dwell in you,<br>
is a paradoxical skew, but relatively true,<br>
from a pseudo-complex perspective.<br>
Today, this would seem about a seed and a tree,<br>
but one day, it could be about we, you and me.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="23"> Name </strong> <br>
<em>
<p>A face, with fame,<br> 
is not just any proper noun with a name.<br>
Unlike very synonymous to their meaning,<br>
they are personification of an emotional feeling.<br>
An object that was once used for identification,<br>
is no longer associated to its subject for justification.<br>
Words with individuality have evolved,<br>
far independent to its parent involved.<br>
Tags are mostly tokens to be pronounced,<br>
for, we are the common nouns that we have renounced.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="24"> Soul </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>I was lost in search of you,<br>
for you were lost in me.<br>
I have searched all around, all along,<br>
the worlds beyond, where I don't belong.<br>
I wandered in wonder, "Where would you be?",<br>
"Within", wailed a woe, which were you inside me.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="25"> Phosphene </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Slowly close your eyes,<br>
then try to memorize,<br>
the patterns you see,<br>
in the dark ecstasy.</p>

<p>What did you see,<br>
in the world of unusual fantasy?<br>
A convolution of your vision,<br>
or a simulation of your imagination?</p>

<p>Now face your head, high in the sky,<br>
feel the sun-filled rays, ask me why.<br>
A light-show will flash your eyes,<br>
deep into your sight, until you mesmerise.</p>

<p>Slowly open your eyes,<br>
and now try to memorize.<br>
Can you forget what you have just seen?<br>
the swirling stars in a twinkling labyrinthine.</p>

<p>If you do believe in what you see,<br>
What is real?<br>
The world you now see or have just seen?</p>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="26"> Stalemate </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>Everything is fair in war,<br>
for, the King is who you are.<br>
Kill the enemy and call them bandits,<br>
trick your army in the name of gambits.</p>

<p>Where is greed in sacrifice of your own pawns?<br>
To triumph, you just calculate the pros and cons.<br>
Sometimes the tables might turn around,<br>
then do not feel ashamed, place your crown on the ground.</p>

<p>In case, if you do get lucky,<br>
shake hands, end the rivalry like brothers of one family.<br>
Compromise and sign a treaty with your mate,<br>
make peace, while your choices are still in a stalemate.</p>
</em>

<hr>
<strong> <a name="27"> Reverie </strong>
<br>
<em>
<p>It seems like a part of my memory,<br>
while I was lost in my own reverie.</p>

<p>I remember few joggers rushing in a hurry,<br>
some lovers chatting romantically,<br>
without any worry.<br>
I had seen an old man reading newspaper,<br>
spilling coffee more often than drinking it<br>
with a sugar-free creamer.<br>
I have seen little kids enjoying their icecreams,<br>
laughing out loud, in their imaginary world of dreams.</p>

<p>There was somebody else sitting close to me,<br>
watching all this quietly along with me.<br>
Although I couldn't see him clearly,<br>
he intended to be working on something really.<br>
As far as I remember,<br>
he was just writing a poem on November.</p>

<p>It seems like I am lost in a reverie,<br>
while it is all a part of my own memory.</p>

<em>
<p>Life is a gift, given to us by Mother nature.<br>
As a token of gratitude, we did engulf it-<br>

Humanity on the top should be a blessing,<br>

<p>Extinct animals, endangered vegetation,<br>
GM crops and unorthodox body mutilation.<br>
How far do we have to go making calculation,<br>
before we completely lose our minds-<br>
get back into this realization.</p>

<p>There are some people around us in disguise.<br>
Run away from them, this is my only advice.<br>
A legion of elite controlling millions, billions.<br>
shape shifting, colour changing chameleons.</p>

<p>It isn't too late to wake up yet,<br>
stop snoozing, understand where we are at.<br>
Stop dancing to the rhythm of their trumpets,<br>

<em>
<p>I think I am just loitering around,<br>
within an empty space, sometimes beyond.<br>
Bound to my own imagination,<br>
I had never seen a world of fascination.</p>

<p>Where am I going, why am I escaping?<br>
I think I am falling, from a tall building..<br>
Before I felt my soul, slip away into the dead,<br>
I found myself drenched in sweat, on my bed.</p>

<p>Connected to Reality, refreshed all my cache,<br>
what has just happened, is always a cliché.<br>
An error occurred loading an empty emulator,<br>

This conversation is gonna be a real scrum.<br>
To begin with, you don't even know the beginning,<br> 
from what had been happening, to what has been happening.</p>

<p>The world doesn't function the way you think,<br>
not at least as you hear or see it, written in ink.<br>
A business calculation, with a political congregation,<br>
an intelligent robotic manipulation,<br>

Alright, it feels like my timer had began,<br>
far before I have realized, I wasn't ready back then.</p>

<p>Luckily, before I could choose something selectively,<br>
the society had predefined few options for me objectively.<br>
This template of life is getting tougher day by day,<br>
I hope the future levels are at least easy to play.</p>

<p>What was I into, what am I up to?<br>
What am I doing, where am I going?<br>
Somebody help me, I think I'm stuck in a maze,<br>
It feels empty here, nothing to gaze, only haze.<br>
Why doesn't anybody speak, I'm waiting,<br>

<p>Hello friend, you out there, I'm talking to you.<br>

an imaginary binder, attached as my reminder.<br>

I, slipt away like a piece of paper,<br>

<p>Boiling hot thoughts of steam,<br>
caramelized my dreams into cream.<br>
I was wondering, if at all,<br>
I could ever snap out of it all.</p>

<p>Why does randomness seem more delighting,<br>
than a semester exam, future determining.<br>
Two words: Not prepared,<br>
is not of what I'm scared.<br>
I need stop my wild speculations,<br>

maybe I was once like you.<br>
What can I say to you,<br>
when I know I was once were you.</p>

<p>What could I do?<br>
Watching this present situation,<br>
is like looking into my past from your future.<br>
A cold combination; Divine determination;<br>
Peekaboo!<br>
I feel like I have grown wise and nice,<br>
but now I realize where I stood,<br>
when I finally understood.<br>
It took me too long enough,<br>
this time, I will try not to bluff.<br>
But for now, Think!</p>
