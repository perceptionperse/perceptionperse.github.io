Perception per se is a tributary concept /a percept of the Theory of Correlation and Coexistance of Unity (TCCU). TCCU aims at providing an idea to understand The Unified Field Theory, i.e The Theory of Everything. It is a concept that comprehends the Philosophy of Life and the Nature of Reality. While Perception per se is an expression through art form, TCCU is based on experimentaion using Mathematics and Science.

More description about TCCU will be updated in the near future. 
Stay excited!
