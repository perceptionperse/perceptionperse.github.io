Perception per se is a tributary concept, a percept to understand the Theory of Correlation and Coexistance of Unity (TCCU). TCCU aims at building a Unified Theory, i.e an idea of The Theory of Everything (ToE). It is a concept to comprehend the Meaning of Life. The Philosophy of Life can be experienced through wisdom, experimented using science or can be expressed by art forms. While Perception per se is an expression through art form, TCCU intends to expound the Nature of Reality, as a whole by comination of expression, experimentation and experience. It aspires by inclusion and contribution into the fields of Lexical analysis, Logic, Number Theory, Set Theory, Automation Theory, AI, Quantum Mechnaics and Alchemy.

More details and description about TCCU will be updated in the near future. Stay excited!
