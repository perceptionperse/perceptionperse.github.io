Perception per se is a tributary concept, a percept from the Theory of Correlation and Coexistance of Unity (TCCU). 
TCCU aims at providing building blocks for a Unified Theory, i.e to establish a platform for the Theory of Everything (ToE). 
It is a concept that comprehends to illuminate the Meaning of Life. 
The Philosophy of Life can be experienced through wisdom, experimented using science or can be expressed by art forms. 
While, Perception per se is an expression through an art form, TCCU intends to explore the Nature of Reality, as a whole, by integrating its fundamental units: Expression, Experimentation and Experience. 
It's foundation is based on inclusion and contribution to the fields of Lexical analysis, Logic, Set Theory, Geometry, Probability, Statistics, Algorithms, Automation Theory, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Mechnaics and Alchemy.

More details and description about what, how and why TCCU, will be updated in the near future. Stay excited!
